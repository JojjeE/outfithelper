Outfit Helper usage:

Open the scenario_gecko.entity.patch.json file in the /editme/chunk0/ folder.
Use a text editor of choice, or GlacierKit if you really want, but the entity will be buried in a bunch of folders.

Change the template and blueprint to your custom *OUTFIT* path/hash. Note outfit, not charset.

Deploy and start the game. Enable the editor in the SDK if you haven't, go into Dubai and find the outfit entity in the stairway.

You can now manipulate material override values and see their effects in real time in the game.
If you have GlacierKit open, you can open the outfit entity and you should be able to make changes there also.

This has been tested very little aside from tweaking some values.
